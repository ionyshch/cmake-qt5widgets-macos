# cmake-qt5widgets-macos
QtCreator doesn't provide cmake as a build system option in its Qt Widgets Application wizard. This project is to provide such template plus make app package all Qt libraries into app bundle.

Next steps will be adding more third-party libraries such as ffmpeg and OpenCV and packing them into app bundle.
